You can download a ready-to-use `.zip` archive from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/releases) and just extract it in the webroot of your server.

### With Composer
If you prefer to install the latest stable release of Formwork with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) you can use this command:

```sh
$ composer create-project getformwork/formwork
```

Composer will create a `formwork` folder with a fresh ready-to-use Formwork installation.

### Cloning from GitHub

1. Clone the repository in your webroot:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/getformwork/formwork.git
```

2. Navigate to `formwork` folder and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ cd formwork
$ composer install
```
